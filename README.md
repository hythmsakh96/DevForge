🧱 DevForge

Generate full project structures in seconds.
DevForge is a lightweight CLI tool that helps developers quickly scaffold custom project hierarchies — ideal for bootstrapping new apps, APIs, or full-stack projects with your own structure.

You define the structure, and DevForge handles the rest.
Templates and AI-assisted automation are coming soon.

🚀 Features

⚙️ Custom hierarchy generation – Create any directory & file structure interactively or via text.

📂 Recursive project creation – Supports deeply nested folder trees.

🧾 Automatic README & main file setup – Bootstraps your project with essential files.

🪶 Lightweight – Pure Python. No dependencies.

🧠 Future-ready – Templates, AI integration, and config-based setups coming soon.

📦 Installation
pip install devforge

⚡ Quick Start

Run the CLI to create a new project:

devforge create myproject


Or enable debug logs:

devforge create myproject --debug


Your new project will be generated instantly with a clean structure.
